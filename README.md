# NFT Marketplace Indexing with The Graph

This project uses The Graph protocol to index and query data from the NFT Marketplace smart contract.

The Graph is used to create a subgraph that indexes events from the NFT Marketplace smart contract. This allows querying and retrieving data about listings, purchases, cancellations, updates, and withdrawals in a more efficient and scalable way.
