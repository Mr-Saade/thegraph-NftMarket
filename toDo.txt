Using the graph
-We will index our events into the graph
-Query the graph 
NOTE; We need to have an active item table so that takes in the listed nfts from the listednft table so that when an nft
gets bought or deleted , we can handle it in our active item table and update our UI accordingly

Anytime you update your schema file,  you run the `graph codegen` command to update your generated files.

In our itemLIsted handler, whenever an item is listed, we need to save the item on our garph and update our active item
We also need a unique id for all of our tokens in our schema and to compute that in our mapping.ts we can concatenate the tokenId +
tokenAddress to get a unique id for each token.
The way we can tell if an NFT is on the market is if the activeitem has a dead address `0x000....dEaD` with 36 zeros.
, it has been cancelled, 
if it has an empty buyer, that means it's still on the market and if it has an actual/real buyer address thus other than the dead
address / empty buyer address, it means it's been bought.

Active item table should have
-id of type id
-buyer
-seller
-tokenAddress
-tokenPrice
-tokenId

ItemListed table
-id of type id
-seller
-tokenAddress
-tokenPrice
-tokenId

ItemCancelled
-id of type id
-seller
-tokenAddress
-tokenId

ItemBought
-id of type id
-buyer
-tokenAddress
-tokenPrice
-tokenId
